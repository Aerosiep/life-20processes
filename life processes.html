   Life processes
They are those processes which are required to maintain life in an organism.
      Nutrition, Respiration, Excretion, Transportation.              
 Nutrition  
                It is the process of intake of food/nutrients and utilization of that food for growth and development.  
Nutrients- substances which provide nourishment to an organism.          
                   ex-protein, fat, vitamins, minerals
 
                NUTRITION  
      Autotrophic and Heterotrophic nutrition.
Autotrophic Nutrition
           It is the mode of nutrition in which organism can prepare their own food with the help of sunlight and water. 
Photosynthesis-
                             The process by which green plants synthesize nutrients from water and carbon dioxide in presence of sunlight and chlorophyll is called photosynthesis  
Steps of photosynthesis-
1.Absorption of light energy by chlorophyll.
2.Conversion of light energy into chemical energy and                            
  Splitting of water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen.
3.Reduction of carbon dioxide into carbohydrate.
Site of Photosynthesis- 
1. Green plastids or Chloroplast or kitchen of the cell. 
2.Each Developed chloroplast has two distinct areas stroma and Grana.
3. Light Reaction of photosynthesis take place in Grana.
4.Dark Reaction of photosynthesis take place in Stroma.
( group of thylacoid are known as grana)



6CO2+6H2O=C6H12O6+6O2  

                      

Above equation is the equation of Photosynthesis

 
Heterotrophic Nutrition-    It is the mode of nutrition in which organism cannot prepare their own food, they have to depend on others for food. 
3 types are – saprophytic, parasitic and Holozoic nutrition. 
 Saprophytic Nutrition    
                                It is the mode of heterotrophic nutrition in which organism depend on dead-decaying matter for food. 
Holozoic Nutrition 
                           It is a mode of nutrition in which an organism has to depend on others for food but involve his whole body to get nutrition from that food.
 Parasitic Nutrition
                           It is the mode of nutrition in which an organism lives on others for food but does not kill their host.
